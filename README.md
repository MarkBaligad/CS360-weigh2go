# CS360-weigh2go GoalWeight app
CS-360 Weight Tracker App Project


## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The GoalWeight app was designed to let users track their weight over time, set goals, and view progress in a simple, organized way. It addressed the need for a personal, user-friendly tool to support health and fitness tracking.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app included the following screens:
*Login screen where the user could create an account and login.
*Dashboard screen for a summary of the user's progress.
*Enter Goal Weight screen where the user can enter their target weight.
*Weight History screen to view past entries. 
*An Add Weight screen where the user can add their daily weight and receive a congratulatory message on reaching their goal weight.
I used clear layouts, simple navigation, and consistent design to make it intuitive. This made the UI successful because it focused on ease of use.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I used modular coding with clear separation of concerns, relying on SQLite for data management and Java for functionality. I also tested small parts of the app before combining them. These strategies can be reused in future projects to keep code organized and easier to maintain.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested by running the app in the emulator, checking for valid data entry, UI responsiveness, and database accuracy. This process revealed bugs early and ensured the app worked smoothly, which is crucial for creating a great user experience.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One challenge was aligning the database with the UI to handle updates and deletions correctly. I overcame this by refining the adapter logic and carefully testing each change, which made the app more reliable.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was most successful in implementing the database functionality. Designing and connecting SQLite with the UI showed my ability to manage persistent data on the user's device while keeping the app user-friendly and responsive.
